# **LocalPulse - AI-Powered Local Market Insights**

# My idea 
LocalPulse is an AI-based trend forecasting tool designed focus on small local businesses. It analyzes digital signals, such as search trends, online reviews, and foot traffic data. This to help business owners anticipate demand shifts and make smarter, data-informed decisions about products and services in their local area.

# Background
**The problem:** Many small businesses struggle with understanding their local markets due to limited time, limited access to real-time data or expensive market research.

**My personal motivation:** The idea for LocalPulse came to me a few chapters into this course. I was discussing my friend’s small business, and she had noticed a sudden drop in foot traffic. However, she couldn’t figure out whether it was due to the weather, a new competitor, or changes in trends. That conversation sparked the idea: What if local businesses had access to simple, AI-powered tools that could give them a clearer picture of what’s happening around them?
	
**Why It’s Important:** This topic matters because it levels the playing field between small, local businesses and larger chains with more resources. I want to empower and encourage smaller businesses.

# How is my idea different?
While there are existing tools like Google Trends, Yelp Business Insights, and Meta's Local Insights, they are often limited in scope, difficult to use, or designed for larger companies with dedicated marketing teams. Most small businesses don’t have access to affordable, easy-to-understand tools that combine multiple local data sources—such as search trends, reviews, foot traffic, and social media signals—into clear, actionable insights.
	
LocalPulse fills this gap by offering a simple, AI-powered forecasting tool tailored specifically for small, local businesses. It helps them anticipate demand shifts, adapt to local trends, and make smarter decisions, without needing a background in data analysis or a big budget.

# Data and AI techniques 

**Data Sources:**

**Google Trends and Local Search Volume Data,** what are people are actively searching for in the area?

**Online Reviews,** analyze reviews from platforms ex Google and Yelp.

**Foot Traffic Data,** open mobility datasets or anonymized location APIs.

**Social Media,** hashtags and engagement patterns.

**Contextual Data,** local event calendars and weather APIs.


**AI Techniques:**

**Natural Language Processing,** to analyze the content of online reviews.

**Time Series Forecasting,** predict future demand by analyzing historical data.
	
**Clustering,** group similar businesses or customer behaviors.

**Anomaly Detection,** identifying sudden, unexpected changes in data.

**Deep Learning,** advanced forecasting.

**Explainable AI,** not only make predictions but also explain why.

# Challenges

**Non-digital factors,** this AI model relies on data that leaves a digital footprint, but many events that impact local businesses are invisible online. 

**Data quality and availability,** smaller towns might not have enough public data to generate reliable or meaningful insights, making the tool less effective in those locations.

**No real-time causality,** the tool is excellent at predicting correlations, for example, it can predict that an increase in searches for "vegan food" will lead to higher demand for plant-based dishes. However, it can’t tell you the exact reason why that trend started.

**Ethical limitations,** we have to handle location and review data with the utmost care, even when anonymized, to protect user privacy and ensure transparency.

# What´s next?
**In the future, LocalPulse could:**

**Mobile app,** give business owners on-the-go access to their insights, with customized alerts that notify them instantly when significant trend shifts are detected.

**Competitive analysis,** provide even deeper value. This allows businesses to anonymously compare their performance against similar local businesses. 

**Integrate LocalPulse with existing inventory systems** to automatically suggest operational changes, like ordering more of a trending product.


# How I will create my model - step by step 
**• Main goal:** Build a predictive model and predict a business's daily revenue based on a variety of other factors.

**1. Data preparation:** Ask LLM to create fake dataset that the model will learn from.
	
**2. Preprocessing:** Translates the categorical variables (Local_Event, Weather, Business_Type) into numeric values. Identifies which columns are "features" (inputs, e.g., foot traffic) and which column is "targets" (outputs, e.g., revenue).

**3. Model training:** Divided data into a training and a test part, 80% vs. 20%. Use LinearRegression, to look for a linear relationship between the features and revenue.

**4. Prediction:** When model is trained, make a prediction on the test data. The code prints out the "model coefficients," which shows how each factor affects revenue.
